## Folder Structure :-
1. Each Problem will have its own folder by the problem name.
2. Writeups will be added to these folders by anyone in the form of Markdown.md files.
3. Name of the files should be number-author_name.md
<br>number = The number of the writeup of that particular problem(Eg. 1st writeup name may be 1-PranavSarda.md, and so on)
<br>author = Name of author who added the writeup

3. !IMP Do not delete someone else's writeup even by mistake during merges.

1. Fork this repo on your account. Read more : https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo
2. Make your changes.
3. Put up a Pull Request. One of the owners will review it and comment improvements/accept it.
4. !IMP Make sure your fork doesnt have a Merge conflict with the main repo. Learn how to sync your fork. Read more : https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork
