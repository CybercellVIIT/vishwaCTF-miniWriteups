# On hold till 9:00 AM 15 Feb, do not change anything till then.

## Folder Structure :-
1. Each Problem will have its own folder by the problem name.
2. Writeups will be added to these folders by anyone in the form of Markdown.md files.
3. Name of the files should be number-author_name.md
<br>number = The number of the writeup of that particular problem(Eg. 1st writeup name may be 1-PranavSarda.md, and so on)
<br>author = Name of author who added the writeup

## Setting up a Problem Folder (CyberCell Members) :- (Refer Fibonacci Number folder for Basic Setup)
1. In the README.md of the problem, add Title, Category, Description, Hints, Files, Points, Solves(Before Event end i.e. Public Solves), & Flag(s) of the Problem.
2. Write a Solution.md, specifying the steps briefly to solve the problem, in textual format. Provide links to appropriate websites whenever necessary.
3. Upload the required Files(if any) in the same Problem Folder.
4. This will be the solution provided for every problem by CyberCell.
5. You/Other Non-CyberCell Players can write any writeups to the problems later on and submit Pull Requests for the same.

## Creating Writeups (Everyone) :-
1. Follow the naming convention given in Folder Structure -> Point 3 and add your file.
2. Include proper detailed explanations wherever possible and needed.
3. Push(if CyberCell Member) OR Submit a Pull Request(if non-CyberCell Player). Instructions for both given below.
4. You may include links to any of your social media(if you want to), at the bottom of your writeups in normal text size so that people may follow you.
